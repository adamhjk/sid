Installing Sid can be a bit of a chore still.  The first step is getting
all of the required perl modules installed.  To get a sid server running:

0. Make sure you have a configured CPAN module.  Running:

    sudo perl -MCPAN -e shell
  
  Should do the trick.
  
0.1. Make sure you have Xapian installed.  You can find this at:
    
    http://www.xapian.org/download.php
  
1. Run "sudo perl dist/install-deps".  This will install all the required
  perl modules for you.  You may have to run this several times to ensure
  that everything installs cleanly.  When it outputs nothing other than
  "Packaged::Foo is up to date", you are ready to move on.
